    <p>Hi {name},</p>

    <p>
        I hope you are well! My name is Paul, and I am a junior at Harvard College studying 
        Computer Science/Math reaching out on behalf of the Harvard College China Forum, North America's 
        leading student-run conference on China. I saw that you worked at {company}, and I wanted to 
        reach out to see if you would be interested in sponsoring our annual conference in April 2024.

    </p>
  
    <p>

        Our forum brings together influential leaders from business, academia, and politics to engage in 
        constructive dialogue about the challenges and trends shaping China's landscape. Over the past 27 
        years, we've had the privilege of hosting distinguished speakers like including Jack Ma, Hank Paulson,
        and Arianna Huffington, and have attracted a diverse audience from entrepreneurs and investors to 
        academics and students.

        I would love to set up a time to meet to talk more about partnering and answer any questions
         that you may have. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to the possibility of working 
         together!

    </p>

    <p>Best, <br> Paul </p>
